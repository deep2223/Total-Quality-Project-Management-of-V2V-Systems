# Total-Quality-Project-Management

The project management of **V2V systems** will cover all the 9 knowledge areas and the 5 process groups defined by the *PMBOK*. The deliverables include at least the following documents:

o **Business case** (objectives, critical assumptions and constraints, analysis of options and recommendation, preliminary project requirements, budget estimate and financial analysis, schedule estimate, potential risks)

o **Project charter**

o **Project planning** (project management plan, project scope management plan, WBS, activity and milestone list, Gantt chart, schedule network diagram, activity resource requirements, schedule baseline, activity cost estimates, cost management plan, quality management plan, quality metrics, process improvement plan, project organization chart, communications management plan, risk management plan, procurement management plan)

o **Project execution** (deliverables, work performance information, quality assurance plan, contract management plan)

o **Project monitoring and controlling** (recommended corrective actions, updated project management plan, requested changes, quality control measurements)

o **Project closing** (administrative and contract closure procedures)


Different tools *(MS Project, MS Excel,Project 365 etc.)* are used to create the above documents.



**OBJECTIVES**

*Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications* comprises a wireless network where automobiles send messages to each other with information about what they’re doing. This data would include speed, location, direction of travel, braking, and loss of stability. The technology behind V2V communication allows vehicles to broadcast and receive omni- directional messages (up to 10 times per second), creating a 360-degree awareness of other vehicles in proximity.
 
 
 
**BRIEF DESCRIPTION**

According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, traffic accidents and deaths are on the rise. V2V is especially useful in emergency braking situations where the tail lights on cars are obscured (emergency brake), such as at intersections and left turns, which have the highest crash incidence. V2V would be a mesh network, meaning every node (car, smart traffic signal, etc.) could send, capture and retransmit signals. Five to 10 hops on the network would gather traffic conditions a mile ahead. That’s enough time for even the most distracted driver to take his foot off the gas. Also, V2V can alert drivers to blind spots, increase awareness during lane changes, and when passing a vehicle on a two-lane road requires crossing into oncoming traffic. Vehicles that could use V2V communication technology range from cars and trucks to buses and motorcycles. Even bicycles and pedestrians may one day leverage V2V communication technology to enhance their visibility to motorists.
